	<h4>My Hobby</h4>
	<p>I had many hobby since I was a child. From a small collection of toys to big collection of anime series and movies. Until now, I still do some of my hobby but some have been forgotten.</p>
	<p>One of the hobby that I develop since my childhood is collecting 'texts'. Mostly I collect is the picture of cartoons such as pokemon, aliens in the Ben 10 show, plants and zombies in the game Plants VS Zombies and many more shows and games that become famous when I was elementary. Then I bind them and form it into a book. Until today, the book is still in my hand.</p>
	<p>Another hobby that I do since I was a child is to collect miniature toys and build a city made of carton. Many toys that I stll have is still being kept. Some of those toys is bought using my own pocket money from my allowance. Some of those toys is the miniature smurfs and Lego bricks that I collected when I was in Junior High School.</p>
	<p>Then there is also a hobby of collecting anime series and movies that is collected since I was in Junior High School. Until today, I collected 200 anime series and some movies that I personally like. My collection is collected from my friends who is an anime otaku and some are personally downloaded.</p>
